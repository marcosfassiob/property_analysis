### Summary

What maximizes the total sale value of a piece of property? After comparing all possible subsets and their criterion and accounting for collinearity, the model regressing the total sale value to the calculated acreage, total structures, total units and land sale value is our most accurate model.

However, the model violated all assumptions. Applying a log transform satisfies every assumption but normal distribution. You should note that this model might not produce the most accurate or precise results and should consider nonparametric methods and models.

Side-by-side comparisons are provided in the "Variance", "Normality" and "Leverage" tabs.

Column {data-width=500, .tabset}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Research & Model Selection

```{r}
mlr_cols <- c(1, 4:8, 10, 18)
df_mlr <- df_w %>%
    dplyr::select(all_of(mlr_cols))
```

My goal for this section is to model what maximizes the total sale value of a plot of land from this dataset. Initially I wanted to include both numeric and categorical data in my model but I would run into some problems -- more on that later. Using the cleaned dataset, and all possible subsets, I picked out seven regressors and compared them and their criterion to each other: `Calculated.Acreage`, `Total.Structures`, `Total.Units`, `Building.Value`, `Land.Value`, `Land.Sale.Value`, and `Total.Building.Square.Footage`. The following shows these results.

```{r}
best_subsets <- regsubsets(Total.Sale.Value ~ ., data=df_mlr)
best_subsets_results <- summary(best_subsets)

attach(best_subsets_results)
table <- data.frame(outmat, adjr2, cp, bic)
colnames(table) <- c("Acreage", "Sructures", "Units", "Building", 
                    "Land", "Land Sale", "Sq. Footage", "AdjR2", "Cp", "BIC")
rownames(table) <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)
knitr::kable(table)
detach(best_subsets_results)
```

As shown above, each criterion points to the fact that the full model is the most accurate model. This *seems* like a great fit to the data -- however, it's not. The model's variance inflation factor (VIF) and the data's scatterplot matrix, as shown to the right, proves that there is collinearity between the regressors.

```{r}
full_model <- lm(Total.Sale.Value ~ ., data=df_mlr)
vif(full_model)
```

This calls for a reduced model.

### Reduced Model & Diagnostics

Our new best model regresses `Total.Sale.Value` with `Calculated.Acreage`, `Total.Structures`, `Total.Units`, and `Land.Sale.Value`. The model summary and VIF is shown below.

```{r}
reduced_model <- lm(Total.Sale.Value ~ Calculated.Acreage + Total.Structures + Total.Units + Land.Sale.Value, 
                 data=df_mlr)
summary(reduced_model)
vif(reduced_model)
```

The calculated acreage, the land sale value, and the total number of structures and units have a direct correlation against the total sale value of a property. This model explains about 60.66% of the variance, as seen by the adjusted-$R^2$ value.

However, there's a problem: none of the assumptions for multiple linear regression are satisfied, and a log transform is necessary. The only problem that comes with this is that `Total.Units` cannot be used anymore since a large portion of the data contains zero.

### Final Model

The final model is as follows:

```{r}
final_model <- lm(log(Total.Sale.Value) ~ log(Calculated.Acreage) + log(Total.Structures) + 
                      log(Land.Sale.Value), data=df_mlr)
summary(final_model)
```

Looking at the graphs to the right (aside from collinearity), you can see a side-by-side comparison showing how the log transform has satisfied all assumptions but normality. With this in mind, this model might not produce the most accurate or precise results. Nonparametric methods should be considered when asking this question.

Natural Cubic Splines
=======================================================================

### How Land Value affects Total Sale Value

```{r,  fig.width=10, fig.height=7}
#Creating dataframe for plot

ns_filtered <- df_w %>%
  filter(Land.Value < 250000, Total.Sale.Value < 900000) %>%
  dplyr::select(Land.Value, Total.Sale.Value)

ns_df <- ns_filtered %>% sample_n(3000)

#Creating NS with different dfs
ns.1 <- lm(Total.Sale.Value ~ ns(Land.Value, df= 1), data = ns_df)
ns.2 <- lm(Total.Sale.Value ~ ns(Land.Value, df= 2), data = ns_df)
ns.3 <- lm(Total.Sale.Value ~ ns(Land.Value, df= 3), data = ns_df)
ns.4 <- lm(Total.Sale.Value ~ ns(Land.Value, df= 4), data = ns_df)
ns.5 <- lm(Total.Sale.Value ~ ns(Land.Value, df= 5), data = ns_df)

#Determining which df is best
SSE.1 <- sum(residuals(ns.1)^2)
SSE.2 <- sum(residuals(ns.2)^2)
SSE.3 <- sum(residuals(ns.3)^2)
SSE.4 <- sum(residuals(ns.4)^2)
SSE.5 <- sum(residuals(ns.5)^2)
SSE.1 <- c(SSE.1, SSE.2, SSE.3, SSE.4, SSE.5)
#From plotting separately, degree 3 seems best

#Plot

ggplot(data = ns_df, aes(x = Land.Value, y = Total.Sale.Value)) +
  geom_point(size = 0.9, color = "royalblue") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ ns(x, df = 3), se = TRUE, 
              color = "brown4", size=2) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = attributes(ns(ns_df$Land.Value, df = 3))$knots, 
             linetype = "dashed", color = "black", size = 1) +
  ggtitle("Natural Cubic Spline on Land Value vs Total Sale Value") +
  labs(x = "Land Value ($)", y = "Total Sale Value ($)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 18, hjust = 0.5),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 14),
        axis.text = element_text(size = 12),
        legend.position = "none")
```

As expected, the value of the land is directly correlated to to the Total Sale Value. The relationship does not appear to be exactly linear, but has a logarithmic curve.

### Summary

I built a Naive Bayes classifier to classify the amount of money a family will pay per month in rent based on acreage, land value and total sale value. Since Naive Bayes is a categorical classifier by nature, I created intervals for each numerical variable and classified my data using this model.

My most accurate model classified the calculated acreage, land value, and total sale value of the property with an accuracy rate of 78%.

### Research Question & Classification Process

Let's pretend that you're a property developer building single-family houses and you bought a piece of land and want to estimate how much money your residents are going to pay per month in rent. Over the span of three years, about how much will they need to pay per month for your net income to break even?

I wanted to view the relationship between the land value, acreage and total sale value of a plot of residential land. Since Naive Bayes is much better suited for categorical data than numeric data, I created intervals for these variables. I would calculate the estimated rent as follows:

$$\hbox{Rent} = \frac{1}{36} \, \left(\hbox{Land Value - Total Sale Value}\right)$$

Below is a table summarizing these intervals:

|   **Interval**   |                     **Description**                    |
|:----------------:|:------------------------------------------------------:|
|    Calculated    |  "Small" if smaller than 0.4 acres, "Large" if greater |
|    Land Value    |  Less than $50k, between $50k and $100k or over $100k  |
| Total Sale Value | Less than $200k, between $200k and $400k or over $400k |
|  Estimated Rent  |    Less than $5k, between $5k and $10k or over $10k    |

With this in mind, the output of the confusion matrix is shown below:

```{r}
confusion_matrix
```

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Summary

Now that we confirmed that Land Value does a large, positive impact on the Total Sale Value, I wanted to see if some other factors could contribute to the Total Sale as well. A column that stood out to me was "Year Built". I assumed this would have some direct impact as well, since properties and estates gradually become more valuable over time. I wanted to see if based off the Sale and Land value, I could predict what time period the property was built. Since there is a wide range of years, I created a new category and binned year ranges together. Before 1995 would be "Old", between 1995 and 2018 would be "Modern", and anything past 2019 would be "New".

### Summary

What makes a piece of property expensive? I used the median property value in Wake County, NC as my cutoff point between a property being expensive or not and fit a logistic regression model using all possible subsets. Before picking the best model, I eliminated all the outliers in the dataset.

After accounting for multicollinearity, my final model uses the calculated acreage, land value, total structures and units as the predictors. After predicting the response and link values and fitting my logit function onto the graph, I concluded my model has a 11% misclassification rate after cross-validating my out-of-sample data using the `cv.glm` function.

### All Possible Subsets

What makes a piece of property expensive? I wanted to answer this question using logistic regression as my classification model. To answer this question, I created a new Boolean variable titled `Is.Expensive`, where it returns true if the total sale value of the property was over \$489,000, the top 25th percentile in our dataset. Before picking out the best model, I filtered out all property where the total sale value was over $832,500 since anything over that threshold is considered an outlier. Using this new variable, I used all possible subsets to find the best variables for my model. The table showing all possible subsets is shown below:

```{r}
best_subsets <- regsubsets(Is.Expensive ~ ., data=df_log2)
best_subsets_results <- summary(best_subsets)

attach(best_subsets_results)
table <- data.frame(outmat, adjr2, cp, bic)
colnames(table) <- c("Acreage", "Sructures", "Units", "Building", 
                    "Sq. Footage", "Expensive?", "AdjR2", "Cp", "BIC")
rownames(table) <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
knitr::kable(table)
detach(best_subsets_results)
```

As shown above, while other criterion point to multiple models having the best fit, Mallows' $C_p$ points to the model with five regressors being the best fit. I proceeded with the model classifying expensiveness to calculated acreage, total structures, building value and square footage.

The following shows the summary and VIF of the chosen model.

```{r}
full_log_model <- glm(Is.Expensive ~ Calculated.Acreage + Total.Structures + Building.Value + 
                          Total.Building.Square.Footage, data=df_log2, family="binomial")
summary(full_log_model)
vif(full_log_model)
```

After looking at the scatterplot matrix and the VIF of this model, I feel like there seems to be strong evidence of the building value and square footage to have collinearity. With that in mind, I refit a smaller model without the building value of the property.

```{r}
reduced_log_model <- glm(Is.Expensive ~ Calculated.Acreage + Total.Structures + 
                          Total.Building.Square.Footage, data=df_log2, family="binomial")
summary(reduced_log_model)
vif(reduced_log_model)
```

Now the VIF of the model is extremely small, but the calculated acreage is no longer significant. With this, we can show our final model on the next page.

### Final Model

The final model (and the model the logit graph is based on) is shown below.

```{r}
reduced_log_model <- glm(Is.Expensive ~ Total.Structures + Total.Building.Square.Footage, 
                         data=df_log2, family="binomial")
summary(reduced_log_model)
vif(reduced_log_model)
```

Only the number of structures and the total building square footage are the predictors. With this we can model our logit function, and after running cross-validation, we only have about a 12% misclassification rate, shown below.

```{r}
cv.glm(data = df_log2, glmfit = reduced_log_model, K = 10)$delta[1]
```
